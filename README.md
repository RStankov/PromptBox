## Installation

1. Download and install the workflow in Alfred
2. Configure your OpenAI API key and model:
   - Open Alfred Preferences ‚Üí Workflows
   - Select "PromptBox"
   - Click the `[x]` button in the top right
   - Enter your OpenAI API key
   - Select your preferred model (default: gpt-5-mini)

**Note**: The workflow includes a bundled `terminal-notifier` for notifications, so no additional dependencies are required.

## Usage

### Running Prompts

1. Activate Alfred and type `p` followed by your search query
2. Select a prompt from the list
3. Two options:
   - **Press ‚Ü©**: Run the prompt with custom input
   - **Press ‚åò + ‚Ü©**: Run the prompt with clipboard content as input (async mode)
4. View the AI response in the text view
5. Choose an action:
   - **Press ‚åò + ‚Ü©**: Copy the output to clipboard
   - **Press ‚å• + ‚Ü©**: Insert the output into the foremost application

### Async Mode (Background Execution)

When using **‚åò + ‚Ü©** to run a prompt with clipboard content, the workflow runs in the background:
- üöß Shows a notification when processing starts
- ‚úÖ Result automatically copied to clipboard when complete
- üîî Notification auto-dismisses
- Multiple prompts can run simultaneously without blocking Alfred

This is perfect for quick tasks like "fix grammar", "translate", or "summarize" where you just want the result in your clipboard without waiting in Alfred.

### Editing Prompts

Type `prompts edit` in Alfred to open your prompts file for editing.

## Prompt File Format

Prompts are stored in `prompts.txt` using a simple markdown-like format:

```markdown
## Prompt Title

Your prompt instructions here.
This can be multiple lines.

## Another Prompt

Instructions for another prompt.
```

Each prompt section:
- Starts with `##` followed by the prompt title
- Contains the instructions/system prompt on the following lines
- Sections are separated by blank lines

### Example Prompts

```markdown
## Summarize

Summarize the following text in 2-3 sentences, focusing on the key points.

## Fix Grammar

Fix any grammar, spelling, or punctuation errors in the text. Maintain the original tone and style.

## Translate to Spanish

Translate the following text to Spanish. Keep the tone and meaning intact.

## Code Review
